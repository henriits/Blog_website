                <h5 class="card-title">Cat and the butterfly</h5>
                <p class="card-text">A cat was chasing a butterfly in the garden. But when the butterfly flew away, the
                    cat learned to admire its beauty from afar, realizing that it deserved respect as a living
                    creature.</p>
                <p>As time went on, the cat learned to appreciate the butterfly's beauty and began to treat it with the
                    respect it deserved. No longer did it try to chase or catch the butterfly, but instead, it would
                    watch in amazement as the creature flitted around the garden, pollinating flowers and bringing life
                    to the world around it.</p>
                <p>One day, as the cat was lounging in the sun, it noticed the butterfly flying closer and closer. The
                    cat held still, watching in awe as the butterfly flew right up to its nose and landed gently on its
                    furry nose.</p>
                <p>The cat's eyes widened in surprise, but it remained still, not wanting to disturb the butterfly. It
                    gazed in wonder as the butterfly stretched its wings and soaked up the warmth of the sun on the
                    cat's nose.</p>
                <p>In that moment, the cat felt a deep sense of connection to the butterfly, realizing that despite
                    their differences, they were both living creatures, each with their own unique beauty and purpose in
                    the world.</p>
                <p>As the butterfly eventually took off and flew away, the cat sat there, reflecting on the lesson it
                    had learned. It realized that by showing respect and appreciation for all living creatures, it could
                    gain a deeper understanding of the world and find peace and harmony in its surroundings.</p>
                <p>From that day on, the cat no longer saw the butterfly as prey, but rather as a fellow creature to
                    admire and respect. And as it watched the butterfly fly away, it couldn't help but feel grateful for
                    the lesson it had learned and the newfound sense of wonder and appreciation for the world around
                    it.</p>
